# Courier-Unity-Integration-Demo
 Extremely simple game created for Courier Live ([video here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1072821015))

Courier Live demo should start on the "missing-notifications" branch. This has all the basic gameplay and UI implemented, but lacks any support for notifications, and is a good jumping-off point for the demo.
